# 3D Models Directory

This directory should contain the `smart_glove.glb` 3D model file.

## Adding Your Model

1. Export your 3D glove model as a GLB file
2. Place it in this directory as `smart_glove.glb`
3. The model will be automatically loaded by the GloveModel component

## Recommended Specifications

- **Format**: GLB (binary glTF)
- **Polygons**: < 10,000 for web performance
- **Textures**: Embedded in GLB or referenced
- **Animations**: Optional, will be automatically detected if present
- **File Size**: < 5MB for optimal loading

## Fallback

If no GLB model is provided, the application will use a procedural fallback geometry that represents a glove shape.
